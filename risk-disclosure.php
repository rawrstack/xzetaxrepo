<h1>Risk Disclosure</h1>

			<p>
					Before deciding to participate in the Forex market, you should carefully consider your investment objectives, level of experience and risk appetite. Most importantly, do not invest money you cannot afford to lose.&nbsp; There is considerable exposure to risk in any off-exchange foreign exchange transaction, including, but not limited to, leverage, creditworthiness, limited regulatory protection and market volatility that may substantially affect the price, or liquidity of a currency or currency pair.&nbsp; Moreover, the leveraged nature of forex trading means that any market movement will have an equally proportional effect on your deposited funds. This may work against you as well as for you. The possibility exists that you could sustain a total loss of initial margin funds and be required to deposit additional funds to maintain your position. If you fail to meet any margin requirement, your position may be liquidated and you will be responsible for any resulting losses. To manage exposure, employ risk-reducing strategies such as &lsquo;stop-loss&rsquo; or &lsquo;limit&rsquo; orders.&rdquo;
				</p>
					
				<h4>High Risk Investment</h4>
				<p>
					Trading foreign exchange on margin carries a high level of risk, and may not be suitable for all investors. The high degree of leverage can work against you as well as for you. Before deciding to invest in foreign exchange you should carefully consider your investment objectives, level of experience, and risk appetite. The possibility exists that you could sustain a loss of some or all of your initial investment and therefore you should not invest money that you cannot afford to lose. You should be aware of all the risks associated with foreign exchange trading, and seek advice from an independent financial advisor if you have any doubts.
				</p>

				<h4>Market Opinions</h4>
				<p>
					Any opinions, news, research, analyses, prices, or other information contained on this website are provided as general market commentary, and do not constitute investment advice. ZetaFX&nbsp; is not liable for any loss or damage, including without limitation, any loss of profit, which may arise directly or indirectly from use of or reliance on such information.
				</p>
					
				<h4>Past Performance</h4>
				<p>
					Past performance is not indicative of future results, as returns may vary according to market conditions. Trading in foreign exchange is speculative and may involve the loss of principal; therefore, funds placed under management should be risk capital funds that if lost will not significantly affect one&rsquo;s personal financial well-being. No representation is being made that participating in a managed forex account or managed forex trading program will necessarily lead to profit. Investors may incur into a series of consecutive losses and substantial equity-draw-downs that can deplete their funds before the occurrence of any meaningful profit accumulation.
				</p>

				<p>
					There are risks associated with utilizing an Internet-based deal execution trading system including, but not limited to, the failure of hardware, software, and Internet connection. Because ZetaFX&nbsp;does not control signal power, its reception or routing via Internet, configuration of your equipment or reliability of its connection, ZetaFX&nbsp;is not responsible for communication failures, distortions or delays when trading via the Internet. ZetaFX&nbsp;employs backup systems and contingency plans to minimize the possibility of system failure, and trading via telephone is always available.
				</p>

				<p>
					The trading platforms provide sophisticated order entry and tracking of orders. Our brokers will make best efforts to fill our trades at the price requested. Trading on-line, no matter how convenient or efficient does not necessarily reduce risks associated with currency trading.
